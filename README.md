pnpm run dev
```

## Frontend Concepts Used
- Routing
- I'm not done with this site yet


## What's this for?
This is just an intermediate fun project before I move on to making actual shopping websites, tentatively named "JShop".


## Future for this Project

### Django Backend
It's better to store data like prices on the backend, where people can't just modify the HTML tags of the prices and buy the items for cheap.

### Storing cart items in LocalStorage
Planning to use LocalStorage (and not clunky state menagement libraries like Redux) to save the state of the shopping cart.

### Dark Mode
Self explanatory.
